# Machine Learning Car: *Tyro*

**Tyro** is my first attempt at trying to learn basic machine learning concepts.  I believe that in order to learn concepts, I needed to try it myself before I use a framework that will do all the work for me. Every time the car crashes, I score the run based on how long it stayed alive and how far away from the walls it was. These scores are then used to compare data sets against each other. Currently, the algorithm is fairly poor and it requires a lot of luck to get it to go around the track, but I'm making steady improvements. It is written in Unity Game Engine and uses the Accord.net framework of C# (Unity uses C#). I 3d modeled a car and attached 3 sensors to the front of the car. I then 3d modeled a map for it to drive around.

## Notes

While this bot does incorporate basic machine learning concepts, I understand that it's poor in it's execution. Working on it :P

## TODOs

- Incorporate the genome model
- Work on my scoring model which still leaves something to be desired
- Figure out how to add many points at once so each addition doesn't make drastic changes
